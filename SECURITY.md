# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security issue, please report it by emailing [mj3184@nyu.edu]. We will respond within 5 business days.

## Supported Versions

The following versions are actively supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| > 4.0.x   | ✅         |
| < 4.0   | ❌         |

If you are using an unsupported version, we recommend updating to the latest version to ensure you receive the latest security fixes.

## Security Fixes
We prioritize fixes for the following types of issues:
1. Vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access, code execution, or privilege escalation.
2. Security flaws in dependencies used by the software.
3. Issues that compromise data integrity or confidentiality.

All security fixes are documented in the **release notes** of each new version.

## Release Frequency
Security updates are released:
- **As needed**: When critical vulnerabilities are discovered.
- **Quarterly**: For routine updates and minor fixes.

## Best Practices
To maximize security, we recommend:
- Always running the latest supported version of the software.
- Regularly monitoring release notes for updates and patches.
- Using the software in a secure environment with up-to-date dependencies.
